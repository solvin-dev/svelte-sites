# Svelte Sites
This is a listing of popular, large, or well-made websites that use Svelte/SvelteKit in production.

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is a modern approach to build web applications. It compiles your declarative components into highly efficient JavaScript code. [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) is a framework for rapidly developing robust web apps using Svelte, providing features like SSR, routing, and more.

Contributions are welcome, however, **this is not a self promotion board**. Websites being submitted must be notable, popular, remarkably well-designed, or have some other distinctive feature(s) that make them worth listing.
